# FakeNewsClassifier

This project is for an LSTM model to predict Fake news on twitter.
Dataset consists of positive samples(real news) from CREDBANK data set and negative samples(fake news) from the Russian trolls.
I have used a pre-trained glove embedding ( reference: https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/ ) trained on a corpus from twitter with 100 dimensions.
